## What is Cinnamon?
Cinnamon is an open-source java framework developed by the [MagenTys](http://magentys.io) team that provides fast enablement on your automation projects.
It is designed with ease-of-use in mind, supports Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), robust extensions and easy to use abstraction layers for popular
tooling such as WebDriver. You can mix and match various [modules](https://github.com/MagenTys/cinnamon/wiki/Cinnamon-modules) depending on your requirements. Let's [get started](https://github.com/MagenTys/cinnamon/wiki/Getting-started) ...

## Why Cinnamon?
As a company, we have faced many challenges with tooling across many clients in various sectors. Cinnamon incorporates our [solutions](https://github.com/MagenTys/cinnamon/wiki/What-does-it-solve%3F)
to these challenges, which means that you don’t have to invest time in solving them yourself.
